        <h3>Introduction</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            The National Basketball Association is one of the most popular
            sports leagues in not only America, but the whole world. It has fans
            all across the United States, and in many countries that also share
            an appreciation for elite basketball talent. The league was
            established in 1946, and today has 30 total teams. Each team signs
            players to play with them through contracts, some of which can reach
            the range of hundreds of millions of dollars over a few years!<br /><br />
            Many players, however, will move between teams when these contracts
            expire through a process known as Free Agency. These free agents are
            in contact with other teams, allowing them to play in a more
            preferable city, or on a team that was greater chances of winning a
            National Championship, or simply for more money. However, these
            matchings are, at times, not optimal. Players may land in a team
            that cannot use their abilities to the fullest potential, for
            periods of multiple years, or lesser-known players may not be given
            the attention they deserve, making teams glaze over their numbers
            and preventing what could have been an optimal match. These
            sub-optimal matchings are the target of our project: a
            recommendation system.<br /><br />
            We are proposing to utilize a matching algorithm that could ensure
            greater pairings for free agents and NBA teams than the turnouts
            that the current process leads to. These teams can use a
            nearest-neighbor matching algorithm to analyze the pool of player
            statistics, allowing them to see which player is the best match. An
            addition, a k-means clustering algorithm could help to categorize
            these players into groups, further facilitating the recruitment
            process for these NBA teams. Based on the results of these
            algorithms, NBA teams will receive suggestions for the best players
            that would fit their team. This would help create the best outcome
            for each team, contribute to a more balanced league, and leave
            everyone happy.

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                    For years Rockets General Manager, Daryl Morey has been using data
                    science and analytics to drastically mold his teams foundations. He built his team
                    around prioritizing three pointers admittedly because the data showed that three
                    point shots far exceeded the expected value of sometimes difficult to make twos.
                    This philosophy was especially relevant in his free agency selections. The most
                    notable being his pickups of Gerald Green, a ten year veteran contemplating
                    retirement, and P.J. Tucker. Both Players significantly boosted his three point
                    success rate. He also focused on developing center, Clint Cappella, and Nene,
                    who had extremely high rebounding averages compared to make up for his three
                    point shooters lack of excelling in that statistic. He confirmed these analytics
                    theories by reaching the Western Conference Semifinals, only to be overrun by
                    another juggernaut team.<br/><br/>
                    This philosophy built around using analytics to find underrated free agents that
                    fit his teams philosophy is one Daryl Morey, who graduated from MIT before
                    serving as the Rockets GM, has confirmed for years by taking his team team
                    consistently deep into the playoffs. Given how sparse the information on the
                    exact methodologies and techniques Morey uses in his evaluation is. We wanted
                    to explore building a recommendation system that would evaluate team needs
                    through varying statistical methods and then recommending players from a pool
                    of remaining players not on the team or specific free agents, would score and rank
                    players that are statistically related to the desired criteria. This recommendation
                    system could be widely used to evaluate and find underrated free agents based
                    on different statistical criteria
